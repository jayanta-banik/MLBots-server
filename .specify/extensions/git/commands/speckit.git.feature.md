# Create Feature Branch

Create and switch to a new git feature branch for the given specification. This command handles **branch creation only** — `/speckit.specify` now creates the canonical requirement artifacts.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Environment Variable Override

If the user explicitly provided `GIT_BRANCH_NAME` (e.g., via environment variable, argument, or in their request), pass it through to the script by setting the `GIT_BRANCH_NAME` environment variable before invoking the script. When `GIT_BRANCH_NAME` is set:
- The script uses the exact value as the branch name, bypassing all prefix/suffix generation
- `--short-name` and `--number` flags are ignored
- `FEATURE_NUM` is extracted from the name if it starts with a numeric prefix, otherwise set to the full branch name

## Prerequisites

- Verify Git is available by running `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null`
- If Git is not available, warn the user and skip branch creation

## Branch Naming Mode

Spec branches MUST use the `feat/NNN-short-name` format, where `NNN` is the
next zero-padded sequential feature number starting at `001`.

Bugfix branches use `bugfix/short-name`, but they are outside this command's
numbered feature-branch workflow.

## Execution

Generate a concise short name (2-4 words) for the branch:
- Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
- Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
- Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)

Run the appropriate script based on your platform:

- **Bash**: `.specify/extensions/git/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json --short-name "<short-name>" "<feature description>"`
- **PowerShell**: `.specify/extensions/git/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json -ShortName "<short-name>" "<feature description>"`

**IMPORTANT**:
- Do NOT pass `--number` unless you are intentionally recovering from a numbering conflict
- Always include the JSON flag (`--json` for Bash, `-Json` for PowerShell) so the output can be parsed reliably
- You must only ever run this script once per feature
- The JSON output will contain `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM`

## Graceful Degradation

If Git is not installed or the current directory is not a Git repository:
- Branch creation is skipped with a warning: `[specify] Warning: Git repository not detected; skipped branch creation`
- The script still outputs `BRANCH_NAME` and `FEATURE_NUM` so the caller can reference them

## Output

The script outputs JSON with:
- `BRANCH_NAME`: The branch name (e.g., `feat/003-user-auth`)
- `FEATURE_NUM`: The zero-padded numeric prefix used
