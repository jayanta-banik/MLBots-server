# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution

<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]

<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->

[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]

<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->

[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]

<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->

[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]

<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->

[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]

<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->

[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

<!-- Repositories that value minimal diffs can require preserving working
variable names, function names, and identifiers unless a rename is required by
functionality, correctness, or compatibility. Prefer additive modification
over rewriting working code into a more complicated equivalent, and avoid
semantic changes without an explicit functionality change. -->

<!-- Repositories may also require Prisma reads to prefer include over select
except when select is needed to avoid exposing PII or internal-only data, and
may require routers to call models directly when a service layer only
serializes, normalizes, or rearranges object structure. -->

<!-- Repositories may also require helper files to live in the exact same
folder as the file that calls them, remain local to that folder, and be used
by only one calling file unless broader sharing is explicitly justified. -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]

<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]

<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]

<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]

<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance

<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]

<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

**Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]

<!-- Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
